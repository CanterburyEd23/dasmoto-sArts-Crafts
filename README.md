#### Technology Used

This website has been built using HTML and CSS.  No JavaScript was needed as this is really a very simple test piece. Git version control was used.

#### Purpose

This is a simple website, built to provided specs, as a test of my HTML and CSS abilities.  As I have already completed other courses on these languages prior to the Codecademy course, this isn't really a challenge.  Therefore I decided to also create this README file, and use git version control throughout, to build familiarity with git and GitHub.

#### Launch

To launch the website, the index.html file should be opened in any major web browser, and the stylesheet.css file placed in the same directory as the index.html file.
